## MIDI Input Management Expert
#### by [voxeljunk](https://linktr.ee/voxeljunk)
a one-stop shop for MIDI CC/note detection, selection, scaling and binding.
- MIDI Learn mode detects MIDI channel and sets CC and Note range start to last received CC and note values
- external CC and Note inputs for bypassing internal MIDI mapper
- one-click Parameter Setup to scan for all custom numeric, button, toggle and momentary parameters in parent COMP
- Autobind mode for instant binding to selected parent paremeters
- auto-scales MIDI CCs to corresponding parent parameter's min/max ranges using internal Animation COMP
- MIDI note to toggle converter with string field for fast, intuitive control conversion
- daisy chain I/O for easy control over multiple instances of a single parent effect or processor
- merged output with MIDI-controlled + all other parent params and lag CHOP for subtle control smoothing
